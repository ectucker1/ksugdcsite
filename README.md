# K-State Game Development Club Website

This is a development version of the K-State Game Development Website.

It is implemented using the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

The design is based on the [old version](https://github.com/daytonltaylor/gdc.cs.ksu.edu) by Dayton Taylor.
However, all the interactive components have been removed to simplify maintenance.
It is a static site with no database requirements.
